7Sense-making/sensemakingability to determine the deeper meaning or significance of what is being expressedSensemakingor sense-making is the process by which people givemeaningto their collective experiences. It has been defined as "the ongoing retrospective development ofplausible images that rationalize what people are doing" (Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005, p. 409).This chapterintroduces “sensemaking” as a key leadership capability for the complex and dynamic world we live in today. Sensemaking, a term introduced by Karl Weick, refers to how we structure the unknown so as to be able to act in it. Sensemaking involves coming up with a plausible understanding—a map—of a shifting world; testing this map with others through data collection, action, and conversation; and then refining, or abandoning, the map depending on how credible it is. Sensemaking enables leaders to have a better grasp of what is going on in their environments, thus facilitating other leadership activities such as visioning, relating, and inventing.
